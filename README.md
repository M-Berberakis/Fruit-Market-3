The third and final iteration of the fruit market assignment.

For this iteration, it was requested that the fruit market provide more options for customers to purchase and for these options not to be hard coded in the program.
So, the fruit market owner now has the options to add up to 5 different fruit to their shop and assign their prices. If the market owner accidentaly adds the same character 
twice, they are informed of their error and are requested to enter a different one.

The rest of the program works in a similar manner to the ones of fruit market 1 and 2
